# Project Euler Solutions
Code Author: Brandon Byskov

**Note:** Due to Project Euler rules, only the solutions to the first 100 problems are available in the public repository.

These are my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. Project Euler is a website that contains many problems that require mathematics and programming skill to solve. They range greatly in their difficulty. The objective of solutions is to solve the problems in a very efficient manner.

All solved problems have a solution written in Haskell. The C++ solutions are older and were written when I was learning to code.

There one solution function for each problem. Each function solves the problem a general, parameterized form, rather than only for the specific parameters given by the Project Euler problem. Solutions can be tried by calling the functions from the main function. The solution functions along with the commented input parameters for the problem can be found in:
* C++: `Cpp/problem.h`
* Haskell: `Haskell/src/Euler/Problem.hs`
